    What is a coding bootcamp?<br>
A coding bootcamp is a technical training program that teaches the programming skills that employers look for.
Coding bootcamps enable students with little coding proficiency to focus on the most important aspects of coding and immediately apply their new coding skills to solve real-world problems.

The goal of many coding bootcamp attendees is to transition into a career in web development. They do this by learning to build applications at a professional level - which provides the foundation they need to build production-ready applications and demonstrate they have the skills to add real value to a potential employer.

Why Coding Bootcamps Are Important
We live in a world where technology is continuing to evolve. Technology is drastically changing how we do everything in our lives. Itâ€™s more common than ever to get around using Uber or Lyft, technology driven transportation companies. Companies like Apple, Square and PayPal are changing how we pay for things. It seems every industry is being radically impacted by how technology is shaping the world around us.

Software is taking over the world. This shift changes how we live our lives, but also requires employees with software engineering skills capable of building the technology that we all use.

Attending a coding bootcamp is a viable path to transition into a career in web development as an alternative (or supplement) to graduating with a 4 year degree in Computer Science to helping fill the need of skilled software engineers in industry.
